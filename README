This is a demo repo to reproduce a bug with Linaria vite plugin and Vite middleware that calls ssrLoadModule in the request handler.

Calling ssrLoadModule in the request handler seems to break hot module reloading for Linaria.

- Step 1) Start server with `npm run dev`
- Step 2) Open the server in the browser and reload the page one time
- Step 3) Save Home.jsx without any changes to trigger HMR.
- Step 4) This should cause HMR to remove the Linaria CSS for some reason.
  Editing the Linaria css code to change the styles adds the CSS back.

It seems when the page is reloaded and the request handler calls ssrLoadModule on the server for a second time it causes the HMR issue to happen. If the page is never reloaded, and the request handler is only ever called one time, then HMR works as expected.
Moving the ssrLoadModule call outside of the request handler also fixes the issue.
